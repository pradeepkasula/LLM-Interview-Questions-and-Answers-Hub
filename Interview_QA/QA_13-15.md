## 📌 Q13: Explain the role of token embeddings in the Transformer model.

### ✅ Answer

Token embeddings in the Transformer model encode syntactic and semantic information. These embeddings are obtained from an embedding matrix, where each token’s index maps to a fixed-size vector. These token embeddings are combined with positional embeddings to help the model retain word order. These enriched representations are then passed into the subsequent Transformer model layers, enabling context-aware understanding and text generation. 

## 📌 Q14: Explain the working of the embedding layer in the transformer model. 

### ✅ Answer

The main purpose of the embedding layer in the  transformer model is to convert input token IDs into dense, continuous vectors called embeddings.  Each token is first represented as a one-hot vector and then multiplied with an embedding matrix to produce the token embedding. 

These token embeddings are then combined with positional embeddings to retain information about token order within the sequence. To summarize, the embedding layer transform the sequence of tokens represented as integer IDs into the sequence of embeddings. These embeddings are then processed by the subsequent layers to inject contextual information. 

## 📌 Q15: What is the role of self-attention in the Transformer model, and why is it called “self-attention”?

### ✅ Answer

The self-attention mechanism enables the model to compute context-rich representation for each token by allowing the tokens to attend to all tokens in the input sequence. These context-rich representations capture long-range dependencies and relationships. 

The mechanism is called “self-attention” because the attention is computed within the same sequence - each token attends to itself and others without external input. This process helps build rich contextual embeddings crucial for understanding meaning and structure in text.
