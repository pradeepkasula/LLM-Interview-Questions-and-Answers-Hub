## 📌 Q115: What is the significance of self-supervised learning in LLM pretraining?

### ✅ Answer

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is crucial for LLM pretraining because it allows models to learn rich, general-purpose language representations from massive amounts of unlabeled text data. It works by creating a surrogate task, like predicting the next word, where the "labels" are automatically derived from the input itself. 

This eliminates the need for expensive human annotation. By predicting the next token in a sequence, the model learns syntax, semantics, and world knowledge from massive unlabeled corpora.
