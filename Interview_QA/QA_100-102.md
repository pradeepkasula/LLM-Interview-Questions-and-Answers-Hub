## 📌 Q100: When should you prefer task-specific fine-tuning over prompt engineering?

### ✅ Answer

You should opt for task-specific fine-tuning when prompt engineering alone doesn’t deliver the desired level of performance. This often happens in the case of complex, specialized tasks in fields like law or medicine, where the base model may lack the needed deep domain knowledge. 

Fine-tuning is also ideal when you need low-latency, cost-efficient inference in large-scale production systems, as it produces a smaller and more optimized model than one relying on lengthy prompts. Lastly, fine-tuning offers greater control over the model’s behavior, making it easier to ensure consistency, which prompting alone can’t always guarantee.

## 📌 Q101: What is LoRA, and how does it work at a high level?

### ✅ Answer

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique that allows you to fine-tune LLMs by updating only a small number of additional parameters instead of modifying all the model’s weights.

At a high level, LoRA works by injecting small trainable low-rank matrices into specific layers of the model (typically the attention or feedforward layers). Instead of updating the large weight matrix $W$ , LoRA keeps $W$ frozen and adds a low-rank decomposition $ΔW = AB$ , where A and B are much smaller matrices ($r << d$). During training, only A and B, are learned, significantly reducing memory and compute costs. 

At inference, the adapted weights are effectively merged with the original model weights, so the model behaves as if it was fully fine-tuned but with far fewer parameters trained. This makes LoRA both efficient (in storage and computation) and modular.


## 📌 Q102: Explain the key ingredient behind the effectiveness of the LoRA technique. 

### ✅ Answer

The key ingredient behind the effectiveness of the LoRA technique lies in its low-rank decomposition of weight updates, which captures task-specific information within a much smaller subspace of the model’s full parameter space. By expressing the weight change as the product of two small matrices, LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning with minimal memory and computational overhead.

This approach leverages the observation that large language models have redundant parameters, and most adaptations can be represented in a low-dimensional form. As a result, LoRA achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning while training only a tiny fraction of the model’s parameters.
