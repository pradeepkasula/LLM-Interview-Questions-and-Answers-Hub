## 📌 Q58: Explain how diffusion language models (DLMs) differ from Large Language Models (LLMs).

### ✅ Answer

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) differ from traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) in how they generate text. LLMs use autoregressive generation, predicting one token at a time based on previous ones. 

DLMs use a denoising process, starting from random noise and iteratively refining it into coherent text—similar to how diffusion models generate images. This approach allows DLMs to capture global context more effectively and potentially produce more diverse outputs.

## 📌 Q59: Do you prefer DLMs or LLMs for latency-sensitive applications? 

### ✅ Answer

LLMs are autoregressive, generating text sequentially token-by-token, which creates a sequential bottleneck resulting in slower overall latency for long outputs. In contrast, DLMs are non-autoregressive and generate text by iteratively refining the entire sequence in parallel, which often offers them a significant advantage in inference speed and throughput for bulk processing or longer generations. 

While a single denoising step in a DLM can be computationally heavier than an LLM's single token prediction, the ability to generate multiple tokens simultaneously over a few steps means that DLMs can achieve a faster Time Per Output Token (TPOT), making them an emerging alternative for latency-sensitive applications.

## 📌 Q60: Explain the concept of token streaming during inference.

### ✅ Answer

Token streaming during LLM inference is an optimization technique where the model's output, typically the next predicted token, is sent to the user immediately as soon as it's generated, rather than waiting for the entire response to be completed. 

Token streaming significantly reduces the perceived latency because the user can begin reading the output almost instantly, making the interaction feel much faster and more responsive. The full response is thus "streamed" out token by token until an end-of-sequence token is reached.
