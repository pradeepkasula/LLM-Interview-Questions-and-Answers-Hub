## 📌 Q64: Explain the role of flash attention in reducing memory bottlenecks during inference.

### ✅ Answer

Flash Attention plays a crucial role in reducing memory bottlenecks during inference by optimizing the way the models handle attention computations. Traditional attention mechanisms incur high memory overhead due to frequent data transfers between slower high bandwidth memory (HBM) and faster but smaller on-chip SRAM, repeatedly loading and writing keys, queries, and values for each step.  

Flash Attention significantly reduces memory bottlenecks during LLM inference by moving the computation of the large, intermediate attention scores matrix (Q.KT) from the slow High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to the faster, on-chip SRAM. It achieves this by using a technique called tiling, where the attention calculation is broken into smaller blocks and computed incrementally, meaning the full, massive attention matrix is never explicitly materialized in the slower HBM.  

This approach greatly decreases memory access latency and reduces computational overhead, enabling faster and more memory-efficient inference, especially beneficial for long input sequences.

## 📌 Q65: What is continuous batching, and how does it differ from static batching?

### ✅ Answer

Static batching involves grouping a fixed number of requests together and processing them simultaneously.  Its main drawback is poor efficiency, as all requests must wait for the single longest sequence to finish, resulting in idle GPU time and increased latency. Continuous batching is a superior, dynamic technique that operates at the token generation level, immediately replacing a completed request with a new one. 

This key difference ensures the GPU is constantly utilized, dramatically boosting overall throughput and reducing latency. Static batching is often preferred in offline scenarios where latency is less important, while continuous batching shines in online, interactive applications.

## 📌 Q66: What is mixed precision (e.g., FP16) and why is it used during inference?

### ✅ Answer

Mixed precision is a technique that uses a combination of different numerical formats, typically using the 16-bit floating-point format (FP16) for most computations, alongside higher-precision formats like FP32 where necessary for numerical stability. It is used during inference to significantly reduce both memory consumption and computational time.  

Halving the bit-width cuts the model's memory consumption by roughly half, which allows for either larger models to fit onto the GPU or for a larger batch size. Crucially, modern hardware like NVIDIA Tensor Cores can execute FP16 operations significantly faster, thus boosting overall throughput with minimal loss in model accuracy.
