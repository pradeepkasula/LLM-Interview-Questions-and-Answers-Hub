## 📌 Q49: When you set the temperature to 0.0, which decoding strategy are you using?

### ✅ Answer

Setting the temperature to 0.0 means you're employing greedy decoding. This strategy forces the model to always select the token with the absolute highest probability at each step, making the output deterministic. 

It essentially eliminates all randomness, favoring the most probable sequence according to the model's learned distribution.

## 📌 Q50: How is Beam Search fundamentally different from a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS)?

### ✅ Answer

Beam Search differs from Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) in that it’s not an exhaustive search algorithm but a heuristic-based, approximate search. Unlike BFS, which explores all nodes level-by-level, or DFS, which explores one path as deeply as possible, Beam Search keeps only the top-k most promising candidates at each step. 

This greedy, constrained exploration makes it significantly more memory and time efficient than exhaustive BFS or DFS, which is crucial for large state spaces. However, it sacrifices completeness and optimality, as the best solution may be pruned. 

## 📌 Q51: Explain the criteria for choosing different decoding strategies. 

### ✅ Answer

The criteria for choosing different decoding strategies, such as greedy search, beam search, or sampling methods (like nucleus or top-k sampling), primarily depend on the desired balance between output quality, diversity, and computational cost. Greedy search is fast but often produces suboptimal, repetitive, or bland text, making it suitable when speed is critical and high quality is not paramount. 

Beam search improves quality by exploring multiple paths and is preferred for tasks requiring deterministic outputs, like translation or summarization, though it's slower. Sampling methods are chosen when the goal is to generate more creative and diverse, less deterministic outputs, as in dialogue systems or story generation, by introducing controlled randomness.
