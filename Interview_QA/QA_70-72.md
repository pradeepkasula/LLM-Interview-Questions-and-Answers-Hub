## 📌 Q70: How do you measure LLM inference performance?

### ✅ Answer

LLM inference performance is primarily measured using latency and throughput metrics to gauge the model's speed and efficiency under load.  Key metrics include Time To First Token (TTFT), which measures how long it takes for the model to produce the first token after receiving a prompt, impacting user experience in real-time applications. 

Time Per Output Token (TPOT) assesses the average time to generate each subsequent token, influencing the smoothness of the output stream. Overall latency is the total time from input submission to the complete response. 

Throughput, another crucial metric, measures how many tokens or requests the system can handle per unit time, indicating its scalability. These metrics together help assess how fast, responsive, and scalable an LLM is in practical deployment scenarios.

## 📌 Q71: What are the different LLM inference engines available? Which one do you prefer?

### ✅ Answer

The most prominent LLM inference engines today are 

- vLLM, which excels in high-throughput and memory efficiency via PagedAttention and continuous batching. 

- NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, which offers peak performance (lowest latency) by optimizing specifically for NVIDIA GPUs with custom CUDA kernels.

- Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI), a robust, production-ready solution well-integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem. 

- Other engines include LMDeploy and llama.cpp (for CPU/edge devices). 

My preference leans towards vLLM due to its excellent balance of high throughput, ease of use (Hugging Face compatibility), and good hardware flexibility. These features make vLLM ideal for most scalable cloud-based serving environments.

## 📌 Q72: What are the challenges in LLM inference?

### ✅ Answer

The main challenges in LLM inference are high latency, computational intensity, memory constraints, token limits, accuracy issues including hallucinations, and scalability concerns. 

1. High latency occurs because LLMs generate output token-by-token, creating delays in real-time applications. 

2. Computational intensity means that running LLMs requires powerful and expensive hardware, leading to high operational costs. 

3. Memory constraints limit the deployment of LLMs on devices with restricted memory capacity. 

4. Token limits restrict input size, often necessitating truncation that can reduce context understanding. 

5. Accuracy issues such as hallucinations can compromise output reliability. 

6. Scalability remains a challenge in handling many concurrent requests without performance degradation.
