## 📌 Q37: What is latency in LLM inference, and why is it important?

### ✅ Answer

Latency in LLM inference refers to the time delay between submitting an input prompt to the model and receiving the final, complete output. It measures how quickly the model processes input and generates output, typically in milliseconds or seconds.  It is a critical performance metric because it directly impacts the user experience and the throughput of applications. 

Low latency is crucial for delivering smooth, real-time experiences in chatbots, coding assistants, or search systems. High latency can lead to slow, frustrating interactions, especially in real-time or conversational systems. 

## 📌 Q38: What is batch inference, and how does it differ from single-query inference?

### ✅ Answer

In batch inference, LLMs process and generate outputs for a large set of accumulated input data (the "batch") all at once. Batch inference is highly efficient for offline or asynchronous tasks like bulk document classification or generating recommendations overnight. This contrasts with single-query inference (or real-time inference), where the model processes individual data points as they arrive, providing responses with very low latency. 

Single-query inference is typically required for interactive, user-facing applications like chatbots. The key difference lies in latency requirements and throughput optimization: batch inference prioritizes high throughput (processing a lot of data quickly) while sacrificing low latency, whereas single-query inference prioritizes minimal latency.

## 📌 Q39: How does batching generally help with LLM inference efficiency?

### ✅ Answer

Batching significantly improves LLM inference efficiency by enabling parallel processing of multiple requests, which maximizes GPU utilization. Instead of processing each query sequentially, batching groups requests together to leverage the full compute capacity of hardware, leading to higher throughput (tokens-per-second). 

Continuous batching further enhances efficiency by using iteration-level scheduling, where new requests can replace completed ones within a batch without waiting for all sequences to finish, achieving much higher throughput improvements. This approach transforms GPU utilization from underutilized sequential processing to optimized parallel execution, making it essential for production LLM serving.
