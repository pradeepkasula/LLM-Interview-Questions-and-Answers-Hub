## 📌 Q112: In the context of LLM pretraining, what is scaling law?

### ✅ Answer

In the context of LLM pretraining, scaling laws describe the predictable relationship between a model’s performance and its key factors—such as model size (number of parameters), dataset size, and compute resources. Empirical studies show that as these factors increase, model performance improves following a power-law trend until diminishing returns appear. 

This law provides a crucial guide for efficiently designing and allocating resources for large-scale model training by predicting the optimal balance of data, parameters, and compute needed to achieve a target performance level. 

## 📌 Q113: Explain the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and its role in LLM pretraining.

### ✅ Answer

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture significantly improves Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining efficiency and capacity by replacing the standard feed-forward layers with a set of specialized "expert" networks. A "router" or "gating network" learns to selectively activate a small subset of these experts for each input token. 

This allows the model to (i) dramatically increase its total parameter count and thus its capacity for knowledge and (ii)  maintain a low computational cost during inference, as only a fraction of the parameters are used for any given input. This sparsity enables models with billions of parameters to be trained and run more efficiently, facilitating the scaling of LLMs to unprecedented sizes.

## 📌 Q114: What is model parallelism, and how is it used in LLM pre-training?


### ✅ Answer

Model parallelism is a technique used to train large language models that are too big to fit on a single GPU by splitting the model’s parameters across multiple devices. Instead of each GPU holding a full model copy, different GPUs handle different layers or parts of the same layer. 

During forward and backward passes, activations and gradients are communicated between GPUs to complete computation. This allows efficient utilization of hardware for massive models. However, it requires careful coordination to minimize communication overhead and latency.
