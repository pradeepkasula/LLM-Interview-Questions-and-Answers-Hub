## 📌 Q103: What is QLoRA, and how does it differ from LoRA?

### ✅ Answer

QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is an extension of LoRA that enables fine-tuning large language models more efficiently by combining low-rank adaptation with quantization. While LoRA freezes most model weights and trains small low-rank matrices to reduce memory and compute costs, QLoRA goes a step further by quantizing the model weights to 4-bit precision during fine-tuning. 

This drastically lowers GPU memory requirements without significant performance loss, allowing fine-tuning of very large models on consumer-grade hardware.

## 📌 Q104: When would you use QLoRA instead of standard LoRA?

### ✅ Answer

QLoRA is preferred over standard LoRA when fine-tuning very large language models on limited hardware resources, such as a single GPU with constrained memory. QLoRA’s 4-bit quantization significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining model performance, making it ideal for resource-efficient fine-tuning. 

It’s particularly useful when working with models like LLaMA that would otherwise exceed GPU limits. In contrast, standard LoRA is sufficient when hardware capacity is not a major constraint. 

## 📌 Q105: How would you handle LLM fine-tuning on consumer hardware with limited GPU memory?

### ✅ Answer

When fine-tuning an LLM on consumer hardware with limited GPU memory, techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or QLoRA can be used to reduce memory usage by training only a small subset of parameters. Additionally, using gradient accumulation, mixed precision training,  smaller batch sizes, and smaller sequence lengths helps manage GPU constraints. 

These approaches minimize memory overhead and computational cost, making fine-tuning LLMs feasible on resource-constrained devices.
