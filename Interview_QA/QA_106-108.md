## 📌 Q106: Explain different preference alignment methods and their trade-offs.

### ✅ Answer

Different preference alignment methods in LLMs include Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). 

1. RLHF uses a reward model trained on human-labeled examples to guide model behavior but is computationally expensive and complex. 

2. DPO simplifies this by directly optimizing the model on preference data without a separate reward model, offering efficiency and stability but depending heavily on data quality. 

3. ORPO combines task objectives and preference alignment in one loss, improving training efficiency but increasing implementation complexity. 

4. KTO uses binary good/bad labels, is robust to noisy data, and is simple to label, yet it may lack granularity for nuanced alignment. 

Trade-offs revolve around complexity, computational resources, data requirements, and alignment precision, with the optimal method chosen based on specific use cases and resource constraints.​

## 📌 Q107: What is gradient accumulation, and how does it help with fine-tuning large models?

### ✅ Answer

Gradient accumulation is a technique used in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that helps manage GPU memory limitations by simulating larger batch sizes. Instead of updating model weights after processing each mini-batch, gradients are accumulated over several smaller batches, and the model parameters are updated once after the accumulation. 

This approach enables training with effective large batch sizes even on memory-constrained hardware, improving the stability and performance of the fine-tuning process. It allows fine-tuning of LLMs on less powerful GPUs and reduces hardware cost while maintaining training quality.

## 📌 Q108: What are the possible options to speed up LLM fine-tuning?

### ✅ Answer

To speed up LLM fine-tuning, several optimization strategies can be used. Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or  QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) reduce the number of trainable parameters, significantly lowering GPU memory usage and training time. 

Additionally, mixed precision training (FP16/BF16) for faster computation, gradient accumulation for simulating larger batch sizes, and distributed training across multiple GPUs achieve quicker convergence and shorter training times. These approaches drastically cut down both computational cost and the fine-tuning time.
