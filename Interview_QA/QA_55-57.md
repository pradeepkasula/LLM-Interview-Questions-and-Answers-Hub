## 📌 Q55: What is the purpose of temperature in LLM inference, and how does it affect the output?

### ✅ Answer

The temperature parameter in LLM inference controls the randomness of the token selection process by rescaling the logits before the softmax function. Its purpose is to manage the trade-off between creativity and determinism in the generated output. 

A high temperature (e.g., closer to 1.0) makes the probability distribution flatter, increasing the chance of selecting less likely tokens, resulting in more diverse, creative, and sometimes less coherent text. Conversely, a low temperature (e.g., closer to 0.0) makes the model more deterministic and focused on the most probable tokens, generating more coherent text. 

## 📌 Q56: What is autoregressive generation in the context of LLMs?

### ✅ Answer

Autoregressive generation is the sequential process by which LLMs generate text, one token (word or sub-word unit) at a time, using the previously generated tokens and the original input as context. 

Essentially, the model predicts the next most probable token based on all the preceding tokens, creating a dependency chain that results in coherent and contextually relevant text output. This process continues until an end-of-sequence token is predicted or a pre-defined length limit is reached.


## 📌 Q57: Explain the strengths and limitations of autoregressive text generation in LLMs.

### ✅ Answer

The main strength of autoregressive text generation in LLMs is its ability to produce  coherent, contextually relevant, and high-quality sequential text. This happens because of its method of predicting the next token based on all preceding ones. 

However, its primary limitation is that it's inherently slow because each new token must be generated serially, precluding true parallelization. Additionally, in the sequential generation process, errors can accumulate over time since each prediction depends on the previous tokens.
