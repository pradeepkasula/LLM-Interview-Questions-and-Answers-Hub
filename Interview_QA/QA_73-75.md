## 📌 Q73: What are the possible options for accelerating LLM inference?

### ✅ Answer

Possible options to accelerate LLM inference include:

- Quantization: Reduces numerical precision to lower computation and memory use, speeding up inference.

- Pruning: Eliminates less important neurons or weights to make the model smaller and faster.

- Knowledge Distillation: Transfers knowledge to a smaller, more efficient model that runs faster.

- KV Caching: Stores and reuses previous attention computations to speed up token generation.

- Speculative Decoding: Uses a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens verified by the full model.

- Hardware Acceleration: Utilizes GPUs, TPUs, or custom accelerators designed for parallel matrix operations.

## 📌 Q74: What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and when is it most useful?

### ✅ Answer

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where you instruct an LLM to explicitly show the step-by-step reasoning process before arriving at the final answer. This process mimics human-like thinking, breaking down complex problems into manageable intermediate steps. 

CoT is most useful for complex reasoning tasks that require multiple steps, such as multi-step arithmetic, symbolic reasoning, and common-sense question answering. The CoT prompting technique significantly improves the LLM's accuracy and ability to handle complexity compared to standard prompting.

## 📌 Q75: Explain the reason behind the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

### ✅ Answer

The power of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting lies in how it helps large language models think more like humans - step by step. Instead of jumping straight to an answer, CoT encourages the model to reason through the problem by breaking it down into smaller, logical steps. 

This structured thinking makes it easier for the model to handle tasks involving logic, math, or common sense, resulting in more accurate and trustworthy answers. In simple terms, CoT gives the model a bit of extra “thinking time” before it decides on the final response.
