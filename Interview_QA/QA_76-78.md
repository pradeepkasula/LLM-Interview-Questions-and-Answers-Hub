## 📌 Q76: Explain the trade-offs in using CoT prompting. 

### ✅ Answer

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves accuracy and interpretability by encouraging models to generate intermediate steps before producing the final answer. However, it introduces trade-offs such as increased latency and token usage, which raise computational and cost overheads. 

Moreover, CoT can sometimes amplify hallucinations if the reasoning path is incorrect. It also requires a careful prompt design to balance reasoning detail with brevity for optimal performance.

## 📌 Q77: What is prompt engineering, and why is it important for LLMs?

### ✅ Answer

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively guide LLMs toward generating accurate, relevant, and coherent responses. Since LLMs interpret user intent based on textual cues, well-crafted prompts reduce ambiguity and improve performance. 

It is especially important because LLMs are sensitive to phrasing, context, and examples provided in the prompt. Effective prompt engineering enhances output quality without retraining the model, making it a key skill in leveraging LLMs efficiently for diverse applications.

## 📌 Q78: What is the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting?

### ✅ Answer

The fundamental difference lies in the number of examples within the prompt. In zero-shot prompting, the model is given only the instruction and input data without examples. Here the model completely depends on its pre-trained knowledge to generate the correct output. 

In contrast, few-shot prompting includes a small number of input-output examples (the "shots") in the prompt. The examples guide the LLM to understand the desired format, style, or task better, often leading to significantly improved performance.
