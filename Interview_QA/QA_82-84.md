## 📌 Q82: What is In-Context Learning (ICL), and how is few-shot prompting related?

### ✅ Answer

In-Context Learning (ICL) is a powerful ability of large language models that lets them perform tasks simply by understanding the input prompt. Few-shot prompting is a specific type of ICL where a few labeled examples are added to the prompt. 

The added examples show the model how the task should be done, helping it generalize to similar inputs. ICL allows LLMs to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data and no retraining.

## 📌 Q83: What is self-consistency prompting, and how does it improve reasoning?

### ✅ Answer

Self-consistency prompting is a technique in LLMs where the model generates multiple reasoning paths or answers for the same input and then aggregates them to select the most consistent solution. Instead of relying on a single output, it considers the agreement among several reasoning attempts, which reduces the likelihood of errors caused by spurious or biased reasoning steps. 

This approach improves reasoning by amplifying correct patterns and filtering out inconsistent or unlikely answers, which results in more accurate outputs.

## 📌 Q84: Why is context important in designing prompts?

### ✅ Answer

Context is crucial in prompt design because it provides the LLMs with the necessary background, constraints, and specific role it should adopt. This helps LLMs to generate a relevant and high-quality output. Without sufficient context, the LLM may misinterpret the user’s intent and rely on general knowledge. 

This may result in the generation of  ambiguous, generic, or incorrect responses that don't meet the user's specific needs.
