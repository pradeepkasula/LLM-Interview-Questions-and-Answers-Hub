## 📌 Q61: What is speculative decoding, and when would you use it?

### ✅ Answer

Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by pairing a smaller, faster "draft" model with a larger "target" model. The draft model speculatively generates multiple future tokens ahead of time, which the target model then verifies in parallel, accepting those matching its own predictions and correcting others. 

This draft-then-verify approach reduces the sequential bottleneck of generating tokens one-by-one, improving GPU utilization and decreasing latency without sacrificing output quality. It is particularly useful in latency-sensitive applications like chatbots and code completion, where both speed and accuracy are critical.

## 📌 Q62: What are the challenges in performing distributed inference across multiple GPUs?

### ✅ Answer

The main challenges in performing distributed inference across multiple GPUs include memory management, communication overhead, workload balancing, and phase-specific resource needs.

1. Memory management is crucial because large models often do not fit into a single GPU, requiring model partitioning or sharding across GPUs. 

2. Communication overhead arises from the synchronization of parameters and intermediate data between GPUs, which can add significant latency. 

3. Workload balancing is needed to ensure that no single GPU becomes a bottleneck while others are underutilized, requiring effective parallelism strategies. 

4. Lastly, different phases of inference, such as prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound), demand distinct GPU resources, complicating efficient resource allocation and orchestration. 

These challenges demand careful orchestration and optimization to maximize throughput and minimize latency in multi-GPU distributed inference systems.

## 📌 Q63: How would you design a scalable LLM inference system for real-time applications?

### ✅ Answer

A scalable LLM inference system for real-time applications should use model sharding and distributed serving frameworks like vLLM to parallelize inference across multiple GPUs or nodes. The system should implement request batching, dynamic load balancing, and asynchronous processing to optimize GPU utilization and reduce latency. 

Caching frequent prompts or embeddings further speeds responses, while autoscaling policies ensure resource efficiency during traffic spikes. Incorporating quantization and distillation can reduce model size and improve real-time performance without major accuracy loss.
