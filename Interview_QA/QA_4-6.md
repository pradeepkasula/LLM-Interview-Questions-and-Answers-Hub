## 📌 Q4: How does quantization affect inference speed and memory requirements?

### ✅ Answer

Quantization reduces the numerical precision of LLM's  parameters, such as converting 32-bit floating-point weights to lower bit widths like 8-bit integers or 4-bit values. This compression dramatically decreases the model's memory footprint, often by 50-75% or more, enabling deployment on smaller devices and allowing more data to fit into cache memory. 

Simultaneously, quantization speeds up inference because lower-precision operations require fewer computational resources and can be processed faster by modern hardware optimized for such formats. 

However, this efficiency gain may come at a small cost to model accuracy, necessitating calibration or quantization-aware training to minimize performance degradation. Overall, quantization is a vital technique for reducing memory usage and improving inference speed in practical LLM applications.

## 📌 Q5: How do you handle the large memory requirements of KV cache in LLM inference?

### ✅ Answer

Handling large KV Cache memory requirements in LLM inference is crucial for high-throughput serving and long context windows, as the cache size grows linearly with sequence length and batch size. We can handle large memory requirements of KV Cache in LLM inference using techniques like PagedAttention, Grouped-Query, Multi-Query Attention, Quantization, or Cache Offloading.  

PagedAttention manages the cache using fixed-size blocks like an operating system's virtual memory, reduces memory fragmentation, and enables higher batch sizes. Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) or Multi-Query Attention (MQA) decreases the size of the KV cache by reducing the number of Key/Value heads. 

Finally, strategies such as quantizing the KV cache (e.g., to INT8) or offloading inactive cache data to cheaper storage (like CPU RAM) also help manage the memory footprint effectively.

## 📌 Q6: After tokenization, how are tokens converted into embeddings in the Transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

Tokens, represented as integer IDs after tokenization, are converted into embeddings using a lookup table called an embedding matrix. For every token in the model's vocabulary, this matrix has a dense, fixed-size vector (the embedding). 

Specifically, the token ID is used as an index to retrieve its corresponding high-dimensional vector from the embedding matrix. This retrieved vector is the numerical representation that captures the token's semantic and syntactic meaning. The embeddings of input tokens are then processed by the subsequent transformer layers.
