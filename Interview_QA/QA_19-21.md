## 📌 Q19: What is the purpose of scaling in the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

The purpose of scaling in the self-attention mechanism of a Transformer model is to stabilize training by controlling the magnitude of the dot-product values between query and key vectors. Without scaling, the dot products can grow large in high-dimensional spaces, resulting in extremely small gradients that slow down or destabilize learning. 

To prevent this, the dot products are divided by the square root of the key dimension,  which keeps the attention scores in a range that leads to more effective gradient flow and stable optimization. Thus, the scaling step ensures that the self-attention mechanism can effectively focus on relevant tokens of the input sequence without numerical issues during training.

## 📌 Q20: Why does the Transformer model use multiple self-attention heads instead of a single self-attention head?

### ✅ Answer

Transformer models use multiple self-attention heads instead of a single one because they enable the model to capture diverse relationships and patterns in the input. This is similar to using multiple flashlights to illuminate different aspects of a scene. 

Using a single head would restrict the model to one form of relationship, limiting its capacity to fully understand the input data. Multi-head attention, by allowing the model to capture diverse relationships, results in richer contextual representations and subsequently better performance across NLP tasks. 

## 📌 Q21: How are the outputs of multiple heads combined and projected back in the multi-head attention in the Transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

In the multi-head attention model of the Transformer, the outputs from multiple self-attention heads are first computed independently, each producing a contextually weighted representation of the input in different subspaces. These outputs are then concatenated along the feature dimension to form a single combined vector. 

This concatenated result is passed through a final linear projection layer,  which projects it back into the model’s expected dimension for further processing. This mechanism allows the model to integrate diverse information captured by each head into a unified representation.
