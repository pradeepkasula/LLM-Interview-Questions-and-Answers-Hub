## 📌 Q46: How does Beam Search improve upon Greedy Search, and what is the role of the beam width parameter?

### ✅ Answer

Beam Search improves upon Greedy Search by exploring a wider set of possibilities. It keeps track of the k most probable partial sequences (where k is the beam width) at each decoding step, instead of just the single most probable one like Greedy Search. This significantly increases the chances of finding a globally better sequence by mitigating the risk of getting stuck with locally optimal, yet ultimately suboptimal, early choices. 

The beam width (k) parameter determines the number of hypotheses maintained; a larger beam width explores more options and generally yields better results at the cost of higher computational complexity and slower decoding speed.

## 📌 Q47: When is a deterministic strategy (like Beam Search) preferable to a stochastic (sampling) strategy? Provide a specific use case.

### ✅ Answer

A deterministic strategy like Beam Search is preferable when consistency, reliability, and reproducibility of outputs are crucial. It systematically explores the most probable token sequences, making it ideal for tasks such as machine translation, summarization, or code generation where accuracy and coherence outweigh diversity. 

For example, in legal or medical summarization, Beam Search ensures factual consistency and avoids random variations that sampling-based methods might introduce.

## 📌 Q48: Discuss the primary trade-off between the computational cost and the output quality when comparing Greedy Search and Beam Search.

### ✅ Answer

Greedy Search is computationally cheap because it only considers the single best token at each step, resulting in a fast decoding time with minimal memory use. However, it often leads to a sub-optimal output sequence because it cannot recover from locally good, but globally poor, choices. 

Conversely, Beam Search maintains k (the beam width) of the most promising partial sequences at each step, significantly increasing the computational cost and decoding time and memory usage. However, this wider exploration of the search space dramatically improves the probability of finding a higher-quality, more globally optimal sequence.
