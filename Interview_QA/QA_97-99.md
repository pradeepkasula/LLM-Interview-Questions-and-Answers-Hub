## 📌 Q97: When should you use fine-tuning vs. RAG?

### ✅ Answer

Fine-tuning is best when you want the model to deeply learn domain-specific knowledge or handle specialized tasks where the knowledge is relatively static and not frequently changing.  On the other hand, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is ideal when you need the model to access the latest, proprietary, or frequently changing information without retraining it. 

It allows the model to provide fact-grounded answers and source traceability from a secure knowledge base.

## 📌 Q98: Explain the limitations of using RAG over LLM fine-tuning.

### ✅ Answer

The main drawbacks of using RAG compared to fine-tuning lie in its performance and lack of deep specialization. Because RAG adds an extra retrieval step, it introduces more inference latency, making it less ideal for low-latency use cases. While RAG is effective at bringing in external knowledge, it doesn’t actually change the model’s core behavior, style, or ability to handle complex, domain-specific reasoning. 

Fine-tuning achieves all these by updating the model’s weights. Additionally, RAG’s output quality heavily depends on the retriever’s accuracy, meaning it can produce poor results if irrelevant information is fetched.

## 📌 Q99: Explain the limitations of using LLM fine-tuning over RAG.

### ✅ Answer

The main drawback of fine-tuning compared to RAG is the model’s static knowledge. Once the model is trained, it can’t access new or real-time information without undergoing an expensive and time-consuming retraining process. Fine-tuning also requires significant computational resources and specialized expertise for preparing data and training the model. 

Moreover, fine-tuned models risk “catastrophic forgetting,” where learning new information causes them to lose some of their original general knowledge. RAG avoids the catastrophic forgetting problem, as it keeps the base model unchanged.
