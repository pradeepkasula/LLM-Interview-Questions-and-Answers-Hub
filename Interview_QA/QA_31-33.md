## 📌 Q31: Compare transformers and RNNs in terms of handling long-range dependencies.

### ✅ Answer

Transformers are fundamentally better than Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) at capturing long-range dependencies due to their core architectural difference. RNNs process sequences sequentially and suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which causes information from earlier steps to diminish over long sequences, making it difficult to relate distant tokens. 

In contrast, Transformers utilize a self-attention mechanism that computes a direct relationship score between every pair of tokens in the sequence. This allows it to capture dependencies regardless of the distance between the tokens in O(1) sequential steps, unlike the O(n) steps required by RNNs. This non-sequential, parallelized attention allows Transformers to effectively model context across much longer spans.

## 📌 Q32: What are the fundamental limitations of the Transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

The fundamental limitations of the Transformer model include its high computational and memory demands. This is because of the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism, which makes processing very long sequences challenging. 

Additionally, they require vast amounts of diverse training data and can be sensitive to biased or low-quality data, impacting generalization and robustness. Despite these challenges, they remain powerful and better than traditional deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs. 

## 📌 Q33: How do transformers address the limitations of traditional deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs?

### ✅ Answer

Transformers address the limitations of traditional deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs primarily through their self-attention mechanism and parallel processing capability. RNNs process data sequentially and struggle with long-range dependencies due to vanishing gradients. CNNs excel at local feature extraction but lack the ability to model sequential or long-range relationships across data. 

The self-attention mechanism allows transformers to process all parts of the input in parallel, assessing the importance of every word/token to every other word/token regardless of their distance. Compared to traditional models, transformers can scale better and train faster on large datasets.
