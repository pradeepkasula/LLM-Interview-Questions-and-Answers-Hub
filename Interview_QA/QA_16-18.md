## 📌 Q16: What is the purpose of the encoder in a transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

The purpose of the encoder in a transformer model is to process the entire input sequence and generate context-aware numerical representations. The encoder uses multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks to capture the relationships and dependencies between all the tokens to generate context-rich token representations. These context-rich token representations are then passed to the decoder, which generates the output sequence.


## 📌 Q17: What is the purpose of the decoder in a transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

The purpose of the decoder in a transformer model is to generate the output sequence based on the contextual representations provided by the encoder and the previously generated tokens. 

The decoder layers use (i) masked self-attention to ensure that predictions for the current step rely solely on previously generated outputs and (ii) encoder-decoder attention to focus on the most relevant parts of the encoder's final output when generating each output token.  

In simple words,  the decoder transforms the encoder’s output (contextual representations) into the desired output token by token.

## 📌 Q18: How does the encoder-decoder structure work at a high level in the Transformer model?

### ✅ Answer

The encoder-decoder structure in a Transformer is used for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation. At a high level, the encoder processes the entire input sequence simultaneously, using self-attention to create rich, context-aware vector representations (the encoded state). 

The decoder then uses a separate self-attention mechanism, masked to prevent looking ahead, to generate the output sequence one token at a time, autoregressively. The decoder also incorporates an encoder-decoder attention layer, allowing it to focus on the most relevant parts of the encoder's output for each token it generates.
