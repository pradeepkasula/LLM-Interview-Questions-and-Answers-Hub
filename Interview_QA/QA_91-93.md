## 📌 Q91: What role does alignment tuning play in improving an LLM's usability?

### ✅ Answer

Alignment tuning enhances an LLM’s usability by ensuring its responses align with human values and ethical principles, making interactions safer and more relatable. This process ensures the model is not only helpful (answering questions effectively) but also harmless (refusing to generate toxic or unethical content). 

By tuning the model to a preference reward signal, alignment makes the LLM's output feel more natural, safe, and trustworthy, fundamentally enhancing the user experience.

## 📌 Q92: How do you prevent overfitting during fine-tuning?

### ✅ Answer

To prevent overfitting during LLM fine-tuning, the primary methods involve using a validation set to monitor performance and employing early stopping when the validation loss starts to increase, indicating the model is memorizing the training data. Additionally, techniques like regularization (e.g., L2 or dropout) can be applied to penalize complex models. 

Lastly, ensuring the fine-tuning dataset is diverse and sufficiently large relative to the model size avoids overfitting and helps the model to generalize better to unseen data.

## 📌 Q93: What is catastrophic forgetting, and why is it a concern in fine-tuning?

### ✅ Answer

Catastrophic forgetting is the loss of previously learned capabilities or knowledge when an LLM is fine-tuned on new, distinct data. It occurs because fine-tuning often involves updating all or most of the model's parameters, causing the new training signal to drastically alter weights important for the old tasks. 

This is a significant concern because it compromises the general utility of the base LLM, meaning the model might excel at the new, fine-tuned task but become incapable of performing the original, broader set of tasks it was initially trained for.
